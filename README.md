# Encrypted Backup Code Retriever

A secure tool for retrieving your predetermined backup code using secret inputs. The tool leverages standard cryptographic techniques (PBKDF2 + Fernet encryption) to ensure that only the correct combination of secret inputs will reveal the backup code.

## Overview

This repository contains a simple yet secure system for storing and retrieving backup codes:

1. **Salt Generation (`generate_salt.py`)**: Creates a cryptographic salt file
2. **Code Generation (`generate.py`)**: Encrypts your backup code using three secret inputs
3. **Code Retrieval (`retrieve_backup_code.py`)**: Decrypts and reveals the backup code when provided with the correct secret inputs

### How It Works

- **Generates** a cryptographic salt for added security
- **Encrypts** a backup code using a combination of 3 secret values and the salt
- **Derives** a cryptographic key from these secret values using PBKDF2 with SHA-256 (100,000 iterations)
- **Stores** the encrypted backup code in a file (`encrypted_backup_code.txt`)
- **Decrypts** and reveals the backup code only when all 3 correct secret inputs are provided

**Security Note:** The source code is public, but the backup code remains secure as it cannot be retrieved without knowing all three secret inputs exactly as they were originally provided.

## Features

- **Strong Cryptographic Security:** Uses PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations for key derivation
- **Fernet Symmetric Encryption:** Military-grade AES encryption for protecting the backup code
- **Random Salt Generation:** Each setup uses a unique cryptographic salt
- **Deterministic Key Derivation:** Same inputs always produce the same encryption key
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line prompts for entering secret inputs
- **File-Based Storage:** Encrypted backup code is stored in a separate file
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12 or higher
- Internet connection for installing dependencies

### Setup Process

1. **Clone or Download:**  
   Download this repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies (Choose One):**
   
   **Option A: Using uv (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   # Install uv first (if not already installed)
   # Windows PowerShell (run as administrator):
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # macOS/Linux:
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # Then install dependencies:
   uv sync
   ```
   
   **Option B: Using pip**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Generate Salt (One-Time Setup):**
   ```bash
   # Using uv:
   uv run python generate_salt.py
   
   # Using pip:
   python generate_salt.py
   ```
   This creates a `salt.txt` file that will be used for encryption.

4. **Configure Your Secrets:**
   Edit `generate.py` and modify these lines with your own values:
   ```python
   secret_part1 = "secret1"          # Replace with your first secret
   secret_part2 = "secret2"          # Replace with your second secret  
   secret_part3 = "secret3"          # Replace with your third secret
   backup_code = "BACKUPCODE-123456" # Replace with your actual backup code
   ```

5. **Generate Encrypted Backup Code:**
   ```bash
   # Using uv:
   uv run python generate.py
   
   # Using pip:
   python generate.py
   ```
   This creates an `encrypted_backup_code.txt` file containing your encrypted backup code.

6. **Retrieve Your Backup Code:**
   ```bash
   # Using uv:
   uv run python retrieve_backup_code.py
   
   # Using pip:
   python retrieve_backup_code.py
   ```
   Enter your three secret parts when prompted. If correct, your backup code will be displayed.

## Important Setup Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Steps for Security:**

1. **Choose Strong Secret Parts:** Your three secret inputs should be:
   - Memorable to you but not easily guessable
   - Different from each other
   - At least 8 characters long each
   - Can include spaces, numbers, and special characters

2. **Order Matters:** The secrets must be entered in the exact same order they were used during generation.

3. **Case Sensitive:** All inputs are case-sensitive. "Secret" ‚â† "secret"

4. **Backup Your Files:** After setup, you must securely store certain files:
   - Your three secret parts (stored securely and separately from files)
   - The `salt.txt` file (**CRITICAL** - without this, recovery is impossible)
   - The `encrypted_backup_code.txt` file (**REQUIRED** - contains your encrypted backup code)
   - The modified `generate.py` with your secrets (store securely, optional backup)

## Critical File Storage Requirements

### üîí **Files That MUST Be Stored Safely:**

**[`salt.txt`](salt.txt)** - **CRITICAL PRIORITY**
- Contains the cryptographic salt essential for decryption
- Without this file, your backup code cannot be recovered even with correct secrets
- Store in a secure location (encrypted drive, secure cloud storage, safe deposit box)

**[`encrypted_backup_code.txt`](encrypted_backup_code.txt)** - **REQUIRED**
- Contains your encrypted backup code
- Useless without the salt and secrets, but still required for recovery
- Store in a different secure location from `salt.txt`

### üìã **Recommended Storage Strategy:**

**Separate Storage Locations:**
- Store `salt.txt` and `encrypted_backup_code.txt` in **different secure locations**
- This ensures no single point of failure can compromise your backup code
- An attacker needs ALL THREE components: salt file + encrypted file + your three secrets

**Multiple Backup Copies:**
- Create multiple copies of both critical files
- Store copies in different physical locations
- Consider encrypted cloud storage with different providers
- Print copies and store in safe deposit boxes for ultimate security

**Security Principle:**
Your backup code requires three components to recover:
1. **Salt file** (`salt.txt`)
2. **Encrypted backup code** (`encrypted_backup_code.txt`)
3. **Your three secret phrases** (stored in your memory)

By storing the files separately, even if one location is compromised, your backup code remains secure.

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid inputs provided" Error:**
- Double-check that all three secret parts are entered exactly as originally set in `generate.py`
- Verify the order of inputs matches the generation order
- Check for typos, extra spaces, or incorrect capitalization
- Ensure you've run `generate.py` after modifying the secrets

**"Salt file not found" Error:**
- Run `python generate_salt.py` first to create the salt file

**"Encrypted backup code file not found" Error:**
- Run `python generate.py` after setting up your secrets

**"ModuleNotFoundError" Error:**
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `uv sync`
- Ensure you're using Python 3.12 or higher

## Complete Example Workflow

Here's a step-by-step example:

```bash
# 1. Initial Setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd ciphered-backup
uv sync  # or pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate salt (one-time)
uv run python generate_salt.py
# Output: Salt generated and saved to 'salt.txt'

# 3. Edit generate.py with your secrets:
# secret_part1 = "MyDogName2023"
# secret_part2 = "Mom'sBirthday-June15"  
# secret_part3 = "FirstCarModel+Year"
# backup_code = "BACKUP-789123-XYZ"

# 4. Generate encrypted backup code
uv run python generate.py
# Output: Encrypted backup code saved to 'encrypted_backup_code.txt'

# 5. Test retrieval
uv run python retrieve_backup_code.py
# Enter secret part 1: MyDogName2023
# Enter secret part 2: Mom'sBirthday-June15
# Enter secret part 3: FirstCarModel+Year
# Your backup code is: BACKUP-789123-XYZ
```

## Security Guidelines

### Best Practices

- **Keep Secrets Separate:** Store your three secret parts in different secure locations
- **Use Strong Secrets:** Each secret should be unique and not easily guessable
- **Don't Share:** Never share your secret inputs with anyone
- **Regular Updates:** Consider updating your backup code and secrets periodically
- **Test Regularly:** Periodically verify you can retrieve your backup code
- **Secure Storage:** Keep backups of `salt.txt` and `encrypted_backup_code.txt` in secure locations

### Security Considerations

- **Random Salt:** The system generates a unique random salt for each setup, stored in `salt.txt`
- **Iterations:** Uses 100,000 PBKDF2 iterations, which provides good protection against brute force attacks
- **Algorithm:** Uses Fernet (AES-128 in CBC mode with HMAC-SHA256 for authentication)

### What This Tool Protects Against

- ‚úÖ **Public Code Repository:** Your backup code is safe even if this code is public
- ‚úÖ **Single Secret Compromise:** All three secrets are required to decrypt
- ‚úÖ **Brute Force Attacks:** PBKDF2 with high iteration count makes this computationally expensive
- ‚úÖ **Salt Reuse:** Each setup generates a unique salt

### What This Tool Does NOT Protect Against

- ‚ùå **Compromise of all three secrets**
- ‚ùå **Keyloggers or malware on your system**
- ‚ùå **Physical access to your computer while unlocked**
- ‚ùå **Loss of salt.txt file** (backup this file securely)
